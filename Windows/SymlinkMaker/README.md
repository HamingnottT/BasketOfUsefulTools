## Custom Symbolic Link Maker

### Description

Perfect for beginners, or anyone interested in batch scripting or in the process of how symbolic links are made.

This program was made to help shorten the process of creating symlinks on the commandline.

This is one of my first scripts using Batch functionality in Windows so I hope you enjoy!

### Instructions and Setup

Simply place this script anywhere on your local system. Make sure to run as admin or you will get a 'permission denied error'.

For advanced users, you can add this program to your path by putting it into a separate folder and setting a path variable to that custom folder.
